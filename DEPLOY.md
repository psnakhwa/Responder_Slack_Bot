### Deployment

### Acceptance Testing

[This]() is a link to our slack team. You can get login credentials [here](). Start the conversation in #general using *'@Trazibot'*. <br />
Following are the acceptance test instructions for each usecase :

#### Initial Steps

* Say *hi/hello @traziBot", so bot will know you are the manager with whom he will work with.
* Wait for bot to respond and then give the repo name to work with. 
* As a simple step of authentication, bot will ask the owner of this repo.
* If they match, bot will list all the commands for each usecase it can perform.
