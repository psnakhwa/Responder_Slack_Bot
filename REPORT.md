## Trazi Bot

Trazi Bot finds appropriate assignees for various issues as well as code reviews and recommend them to the manager and thus reduce manager’s workload.

#### The problem your bot solved

Nowadays, a major concern for all the managers in any software company is to find the people to work on new as well as existing issues in a project. It is also an extremely tedious task for the manager to manually ensure that all the employees are not just assigned to an issue but are also working on the issues which are the best possible assignment for them as per their potential. Under utilization (inefficient resource allocation) of an employee’s potential can be considered as a wastage of critical company resources.
Secondly, when an employee is assigned to work on an existing issue he/she needs an understanding of the code and associated errors previously worked upon by another team member which becomes tough for him to identify. A solution for this will quickly ensure peer-mapping and reduce effort to understand the code.
Thirdly, it is hard to find the right developer who can review the code written by other employees. Code review is critical to maintain the standard of code that goes in production. So, to find the right person for a particular task is a major challenge that needs to be addressed as effectively as possible.

#### Reflection on the development process

* The development process for this project was challenging but every milestone involved lots of learning like first milestone was the most important part as it involved brainstorming to frame our actual problem statement as well as thinking of appropriate solutions without much knowledge of existing technology. 
* Second milestone involved setting up bot environment in slack environment and develop mock based interaction. Here we actually thought and finalized our actual implementation, architecture and technologies. 
* In milestone 3, we finally implemented internal logic that we brainstormed throughout the first 3 milestones to perform actual services of the bot. 
* As suggested throughout this project, we made use of agile methodology to understand our problem initially and daily meetings also reduced the chances of implementation error during each milestones. We used pair-programming during our actual implementation of Milestone 3 as it would speed up each assigned task as well as simultaneous debugging. 
* Instead of approaching a hierarchical grouping, we actually worked in a flexible manner knowing strong and weak points of ourself as well as team members. 
* Early completion of one’s task would also encourage him to extend his helping hand to contribute to other tedious tasks.
* We would also set deadlines for each assigned task on trello task tracking which would also remind each one about the deadline.
