## Problem statement
Nowadays, one of the major concerns in software industry is efficient utilization of company’s resources.  The time which developers spend doing nothing can add up pretty quickly which indirectly slows the product development. For example, ensuring that all the employees are working on some issue or the other at all times is an important task of product manager. Neglecting this will surely bring down company’s growth rate. Moreover, even if the managers decide to keep a track of each and every employee’s current progress, it is a very tiresome and complex task to do this manually. Also, just ensuring that all the employees are working on some issue is not good enough. The manager must also ensure that all the employees are working on the issues which are the best possible assignment for them according to their potential. Under utilization of an employee’s potential can also be considered as a wastage of critical company resources. Finally, the manager himself has more important tasks to work on instead of this repetitive task. So the time manager spends on tracking other employees’ progress is a wastage of his own precious time. So, it is better for the company that it’s product manager spends least possible time on such trivial tasks. These are some crucial software engineering problems which need to be addressed as effectively as possible.
## Bot Description
The Bugbot would be a great solution for all the problems we mentioned above. It’s main aim would be to reduce manager’s workload by seamlessly automating the monotonous process of tracking issues and recommending appropriate assignees.

The bugbot will have the following workflows:

Manager asks for all issues → BugBot provides a list →  Manager provides a particular issue name → BugBot uses text mining to extract the critical information from the issue name and maps it with commit history of all the developers to  recommend the best possible assignee for that issue → BugBot provides a list of best possible assignees to the manager. → Manager selects one name from that list → BugBot assigns the issue to that developer and notifies him accordingly.

Manager provides a filename → BugBot provides a list of developers who committed on that file in the past → Manager provides a name of one developer → BugBot assigns the issue to that developer and notifies him/her.

Manager provide “number of days” as a parameter to the bot → BugBot provides a list of issues which are due before that deadline.

These workflows will save the manager’s time and improve productivity of the team. The BugBot will have conversation with the manager and will notify the manager as well as the developers of all the important events. BugBot would best fit into the Responder bot category since it will respond to an event created by the manager and then make api calls to fetch data, process it and provide its response. The BugBot will follow a Reactor design pattern as it will respond to the events generated by the manager. The BugBot can be considered as a combination of a Chatbot and a Code Drone as it will have a conversation with the manager and perform repetitive programming tasks in an autonomous manner. It will only need manager input to confirm the assignment.

## Use Cases

```
Use Case 1: Recommend an assignee for a new github issue to a manager based on employee’s skill set.
1 Preconditions:
  Manager must have Slack and github tokens on the system.
2 Main Flow:
  A manager requests for a list of employees that can best solve a particular open issue. Bot will return a list of employees whose skill set match the ones required to solve that issue. Manager selects an employee, the bot assigns the issue to that employee.
3 Subflows:
[S1] Manager requests for a list of employees to solve an issue.
[S2] Bot returns a list of employees most appropriate to solve that issue. Manager selects an employee.
[S3] Bot assigns the issue to the selected employee.
4 Alternative Flows
[E1] Issue does not exist.
[E2] Issue already in closed state.
```
```
Use Case 2: Providing the manager with a list of major contributors for a buggy code.
1 Preconditions
  Manager must have Slack and github tokens on the system. Manager must know the filename where the buggy code lies.
2 Main Flow
  Manager provides the filename of the code where bug has been reported. Bot returns a list of employees who have made major commits to that file in recent times. Manager selects an employee, bot creates an issue for the same and assigns it to that employee.
3 Subflows
[S1] Manager provides filename of buggy code
[S2] Return list of major contributors of that code. Manager selects an employee.
[S3] An issue is created for the bug and assigned to the selected employee. 
4 Alternative Flows
[E1] No such file exists in the repository.
```
```
Use Case 3: Provide list of issues that are due to be solved in the next given number of days
1 Preconditions
  Manager must have Slack and github tokens on the system.
2 Main Flow
  Bot will return a list of issues and the assignees of the issues that are supposed to get closed within the specified number of days. Bot will ask the manager if he wants to notify any of the mentioned assignees.  
3 Subflows
[S1] Manager provides a number of days to find the issues that are due within those many days.
[S2] Bot returns a list of issues and the employees working on those issues.
[S3] If the manager chooses to notify any employee about the upcoming deadline, the bot notifies the employees about the same.
4 Alternative Flows
[E1] No issue due within the given time frame.
```

## Architecture Design
Architecture best represents a repository architecture pattern, in which the data for all the issues, every developer's’ past issue work and commit history are being pulled more often than pushed (like creating and assigning an issue) to Github. 

The users will use slack(Bot UI) as an interface to communicate with the bot, which will process the commands given by user and will get all the required data from github and provide user the output in a predefined format and may notify users based on the requirement. Node.js will be used as a backend with third-party libraries. 

<img src="/images/arch.jpg"/>

We will use Github REST api as an API gateway between bot and Github. Our project repository will be saved on the github. When bot receives a command, it (Node.js script) will call REST apis to request a required information (eg. people who can solve an issue, people who can be responsible for a bug, list of issues within deadline). As per the command bot will run an algorithm to find the right set of people to solve an issue (using issue heading, description, user's commit history, and labels) or an algorithm to find people who might be responsible for introducing or fixing a particular bug (may be using git blame and other ways). Through this bot will try to find a best possible matches.

AWS EC2 instance will have our bot deployed. This is the component where all the parsing, analysis and processing will be done. Bot will parse a command given by user to determine what action it is supposed to execute. These actions may involve pulling required data from github or pushing changes to modify issues (eg. add or change assignee, create an issue)

## Additional Patterns
* We will require a mixture of patterns in order to make the BugBot work efficiently and accurately. 
* Two main patterns that we are going to use are Conversationists and Singleton Design pattern and these are the most used design patterns used for bit design. 
* As mentioned in [Conversationist pattern](http://willschenk.com/bot-design-patterns/#conversationists) we want to create this bugbot which will
React to messages : 
  -It will reply to messages which are tagged to him. (eg. message > @BugBot give me a list of employees.
  -Knows who they are talking to : BugBot will know who sent him the message and will tag on appropriate messages. (not all responses).
  -Can learn from what was said : For example, if bot has already notified the developer and the manager commands again then bot won’t do it.
* Second pattern that we are going to use is Singleton design pattern.  As we know Singleton: defines an instance operation that lets clients access its unique interface and clients access a Singleton instance solely through Singleton’s Instance operation.
* Obviously we cannot have > 1 instance of bot as we want to avoid race condition of multiple bots working on same command from the manager. So one client --> one interface --> one bot. Client here is not individual users, infact we can say client is “one channel with a group of managers”.
